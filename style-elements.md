## Style Elements

Some suggestions on ways to establish the book's "style". Totally open to changes here. -- @mamund

### Structural Elements

 * **Highlights :** A few bullets (five or less) that summarize the content of the chapter. see [example here](images/2020-11-24-cnbc-style-bullets.png).
 * **Summary :** One or two short paragraphs that tell the reader what they just read. "In this chaper we covered..." Also includes at least one sentence lead-in to the next chapter ("Next, we'll see how you can apply these prinicples to a running example.").
 * **References :** A bullet list of at least two external references to other material. Either as diret support from in-chapter materials (e.g. a book/article that was referenced) or as a stand alone additional book of interest.
 * **Images :** Each chapter should have at least one illustration/image to support the material
* **Other? :** What other things should we consider here?
