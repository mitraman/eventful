## Highlights

Designing any API-enabled system takes a reasonable amount of technology "know-how". You need to understand at least the basics of networks, coding and integration tools to put together a solution that works with composable parts. But, for most orgniasiations its not enough for an API-enabled system to work. It also needs to work *well* - and that requires a special kind of design skill and experience.

To work well, the software needs to enable some kind of objective. For example, a business that wants to cut down on costs will want software that requires less people to maintain. An 

In an eventful system there are three factors that have the biggest impact on design: coupling, distance and time. Let's take a look at each of these areas and the decisions that you'll need to make

## Coupling

One of the goals you'll often hear software archtiects talk about is less or looser coupling between systems. [Coupling is TK.] The advantage of a system with less coupling between components is that change can happen indepentally. That means if we change the code in one component we won't need to change the code in other components in the system.

[TK sidenote - Larry Constantine, structured design]

Loose coupling can enable a software team to realise great benefits. In a truly loosely coupled systems, the cost of changing code is reduced because the impact of a change is well bounded. For example, if two modules A and B are loosely coupled, I can run a project to change the code in module A without having to change, test or coordinate with module B at all. That can greatly in crease change velocity and cost. 

In realty, coupling isn't a binary characteristic that you can just turn off or on. It turns out to be a spectrum with many different facets (footnote - Eric's paper). You can get the benefits of loosely coupled systems if you can manage to actually de-couple the parts that matter.
