# Preface (Mike)

*(3 pgs)*

## Who Should Read This Book?
In our recent consulting experience, we've seen a steady increase in the use of event-driven architecture (EDA) in companies of all sizes. In particular we've noticed that organizations that already have a well-establised software engineering culture tend to struggle when introducing EDA to their developer community. It was our collaboration with these kinds of companies that encouraged us to put together this small book on how to successfully move from a primarily RESTful style to a style that includes more event-driven (what we are calling EVENTful) implementatations.

This book is aimed at giving experienced software architects and senior developers a quick overview of the differences and challenges you're likely to encounter as you increase your use of EDA solutions. However, we've structured the book to make it valuable to decision-makers throughout organizations of any size. 

### Overview for Decision-Makers
If your goal is to get "the lay of the land" for event-driven architecture and a quick overview of the opportunities and challenges companies face as they dive into the event-driven pool, you can focus on reading chapters 1 and 6, skim 2 and 3, and skip chapters 4 and 5.

### Crash Course for Architects and Team Leads
If you will be responsible for supervising the introduction of EDA and setting design and implementation policies, we recommmend you skim chapters 1 and 2, focus on chapter 2 & 3, and review 4 & 5 as well. 

### Examples for Developers and Designers

No matter your role in the company, you can get a lot from the book relatively quickly by reading the Highlights section at the start of each chapter.
