## LeanPub Build Notes

_notes on building previews for LeanPub_


 * log into LeanPub 
 * got to the preview page of the book https://leanpub.com/fromrestfultoeventful/preview
 * scan to the bottom of the page and look for (and click) the "Create Preview" button
 * you'll get a live progress bar at the top
 * you'll get an email when complete (download links in the email)

_FWIW: this all gets easier if/when we level up to the API edition. that's when we can wscript out all of this from the command line._
